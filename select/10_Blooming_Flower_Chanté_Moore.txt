I've gone there with you now I've got to U-turn but
I don want to because I want you carefully
Get a hold of yourself girl and gather all you gave
It's impossible, irreversible
Time spent with you is gone but with you
Our time lives on

Blooming flower cut before its time
And never to be free to live in the sun
Blooming flower cut before its time
And never to be free to live in the sun

I want the sun to shine on me
I need the sun to shine on our love
Let me feel the warmth of it
Nourishing our feelin'

In the heat we reflect the light
Shining colors of a love that's ours
Has our time come too late or is it too soon?
Bloom flower bloom

And in your eyes I see
The places I long to be
I can see and feel you lovin' me
But I cant go there, I've got to go
I'm bound on a course set before we met
What can I do with my feelings for you

Shall I hide them deep inside my heart
Shall they be placed upon my shelf
Oh, their eyes would not believe
They couldn't see the beauty of you and me

Our blooming flower, cut before it's time
And never to be free to breathe in the sun
And never to be free to breathe in the sun

I want the sun to shine on me
I need the sun to shine on our love
Let me feel the warmth of it
Nourishing our feelin'

In the heat we reflect the light
Shining colors of a love that's ours
Has our time come too late or is it too soon?
Bloom flower bloom

Bloom flower bloom
Bloom flower bloom
Bloom flower bloom

Cut before it's time

I need the sun to shine on me
I need the sun to shine on our love
Let me feel the warmth of it
Nourishing our feelin'

In the heat, we reflect the light
Shining colors of a love that's ours
Has our time come too late or is it too soon?
Bloom flower bloom

Shine on me
I need the sun to shine on our love
Let me feel the warmth of it
Nourishing our feelin'

In the heat, we reflect the light
Shining colors of a love that's ours
Has our time come too late or is it too soon?
Bloom flower bloom

Bloom flower bloom
Bloom flower bloom
