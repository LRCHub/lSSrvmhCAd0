Another lazy day just like any day
Just hanging with my friends, always joking
Sometimes it's kinda fun, sometimes I get bored
It's not so bad though
I can't help but long for more
想像じゃ足りないくらいのImageがBreak out!
夢見たいのさ Can I believe?
Blooming! Just wake it up right now
突然脳天を突き刺すFantasy
Dream it! Don't dream it in the night
逃さないでPrecious one
Growing! Let's hurry up right now
無限大の未来開けるMystery
Dream it! Don't dream it in the night
まだ眠ってる夢を Blooming!
Which way is the right way, go on or go back?
What does the future hold? No one knows
Sometimes it's kinda tough, sometimes I get down
But I believe I can find something new and fun
絶対のAnswerがあったら冒険じゃないや
迷いを捨てて I'll go forward!
Blooming! Just go ahead this way
太陽より指差す方がDestiny
Feel it! Don't hesitate your step
その一歩がFrontier
Growing! Let's open up the door
行く手阻む壁の向こうCan't you see?
Feel it! Don't hesitate your step
まだ見えぬ未来を Blooming!
想像じゃ足りないくらいの現実がCome out!
夢見てるのさ Now I believe!
Blooming! めくるめいて
心揺らす新たなる世界へ
Dream it! Don't dream it in the night
逃さないでPrecious one
Growing! Let's hurry up right now
無限大の未来開けるMystery
Dream it! Don't dream it in the night
まだ眠ってる夢を Bloom it now!
