Lo, how a rose e'er blooming
From tender stem hath sprung!
Of Jesse's lineage coming
As men of old have sung
It came, a floweret bright
Amid the cold of winter
When half-spent was the night

Isaiah 'twas foretold it
The rose I have in mind
With Mary we behold it
The virgin mother kind
To show God's love aright
She bore to us a savior
When half-spent was the night

Lo, how a rose e'er blooming
From tender stem hath sprung!
Of Jesse's lineage coming
As men of old have sung
It came, a floweret bright
Amid the cold of winter
When half-spent was the
When half-spent was the
When half-spent was the night
